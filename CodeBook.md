#Code book to describe variables in Tidy Data set.
The resulting data set includes 180 observations and 69 variables.

##Variable List

*Subject -> A range from 1 to 30 that identifies the subject who performed the acitivity.
*Activity -> The type of activity performed and the corresponding measurements.
*Number -> primary key field used to combine the full data with the activity labels.
